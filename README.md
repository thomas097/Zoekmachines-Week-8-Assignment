# Zoekmachines-Week-8-Assignment
This repository contains the Elastic Search asignment for Zoekmachines 2018. The project is described in-depth on the following wiki page:


https://github.com/thomas097/Zoekmachines-Week-8-Assignment/wiki/Zoekmachines-Elastic-Search-Assignment


``` Currently: this page contains a simple implementation of keyword search (elastic_search_test.py) in a set of fake docs. Also it contains a zip with a Flask web app which fakes the search (but gives a nice html preview). We can combine these two easily to create the demo (see comment in flask file) when we are done.```
