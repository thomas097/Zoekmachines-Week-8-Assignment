REEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDD
``` Currently: this page contains a simple implementation of keyword search (elastic_search_test.py) in a set of fake docs. Also it contains a zip with a Flask web app which fakes the search (but gives a nice html preview). We can combine these two easily to create the demo (see comment in flask file) when we are done.```

```READ: if you want to try the metry-lyrics dataset run the metrolyrics_to_index.py with the usage in hte header! This creates the index in elastic search called songs which we can search in.```

```
Q1 is done...
